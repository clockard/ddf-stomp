# [DDF STOMP](https://tools.codice.org/wiki/display/DDF/DDF+STOMP)


## Introduction
This project provides a STOMP based interface into the DDF Catalog and also allows for the creation of subscriptions. A user can send a JSON based message with a query in CQL format and create a subscription that will return matching content items when added to the DDF Catalog. 

Additionally, it builds a feature application (kar) that can be deployed to an Apache Karaf (http://karaf.apache.org/) server which contains all of the necessary dependencies. This application install has been tested with Apache Karaf 2.3.2.
